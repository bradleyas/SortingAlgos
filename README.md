# SortingAlgos
Sorting Algorithms implemented in Java
My goal is to simply gain understanding of various sorting algorithms by implementing them in Java.

Among the algorithms I will implement are:

BubbleSort
Mergesort
Quicksort
InsertionSort
Quicksort with Threads
Mergesort with Threads
Any others I can find that look interesting.
